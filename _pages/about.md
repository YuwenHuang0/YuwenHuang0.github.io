Welcome! I'm an information theorist whose work sits squarely in data science's core pillars—statistics, machine learning (ML), and optimization. I design probabilistic and combinatorial models that yield provable, scalable inference and decision-making. One line develops graphical-model tools (e.g., Bethe partition functions and graph covers) that connect counting, learning, and optimization—techniques widely used across modern ML. A complementary line studies quantum-enhanced computation, where tensor-network methods and distributed quantum systems act as data-centric accelerators for large-scale inference and optimization. Together, these efforts aim at reliable analytics that align with DSA's mission to unify statistics, ML, and optimization for real-world impact.

Research interests

- Probabilistic graphical models & combinatorial inference for scalable learning and uncertainty quantification.
- Optimization for machine learning (ML) and decision-making (convex/nonconvex methods with provable guarantees).
- Tensor-network and quantum-enabled inference methods for high-dimensional data and ML model compression.
- Distributed quantum computing & quantum networks as emerging platforms for data-intensive analytics.
