welcome! I am an information theorist in statistics, optimization, and combinatorics. I develop graphical-model and quantum-enabled methods—Bethe/graph-cover tools, tensor networks, distributed quantum systems—for provable, scalable inference and optimization, with applications in machine learning (ML).

Research interests

- Probabilistic graphical models & combinatorial inference for scalable learning and uncertainty quantification.
- Optimization for machine learning (ML) and decision-making (convex/nonconvex methods with provable guarantees).
- Tensor-network and quantum-enabled inference methods for high-dimensional data and ML model compression.
- Distributed quantum computing & quantum networks as emerging platforms for data-intensive analytics.
