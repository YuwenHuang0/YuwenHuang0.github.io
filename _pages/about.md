Welcome! I am Yuwen Huang, a postdoc in computer science and engineering (CSE) department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I obtained my Phd degree at CUHK.

I am a information theorist, with broad interests in classical and quantum information processing, optimization theory, and combinatorics. Some of my current research interests include:

- Quantum network
- Graphical model-based characterization of quantum non-locality
- Belief propagation on graphical models representing classical and quantum information processing systems
- Bethe approximation of computational problems
